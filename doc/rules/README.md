# Rules

The secret behind a well constructed unit is, that there are no secrets, you only have to observe some basic rules:

## Rule nº 1
Every gadget has some kind of platform or base, where you can attach all the other components. Plan ahead, whether you will have a 3D printed one, a laser cut or a fracker platform you should plan ahead.

## Rule nº 2
Every gadget has some kind of brains, so you should choose wisely, regarding power requirements, sensors you will want to attach, programming skills needed, price range, …

## Rule nº 3
If it’s going to move it has to have a motor of some kind. The kind you can find in broken electronics, are the cheapest ones, and there is the bonus of upcycling. You could buy new motors but that’s going to stretch your budget.

## Rule nº 4
Play safe, when you add motors, you should add a motor driver, whether you build one yourself or buy a ready made model, a motor driver is mandatory, it keeps the brains safe and makes it easy to connect everything together.

## Rule nº 5
Sure you can build an autonomous model, but the fun is in having your gadget under control. Every smartphone has Bluetooth and wifi, even infrared is quite common these days in consumer electronics. So you should add communications.

## Rule nº 6
You need to power your gadget, it won’t run on air and sympathy. There is a catch on this one, the heavier the gadget; the more power will be needed to move. Rechargeable batteries, solar power, take your pick, but remember it wont run forever.

## Rule nº 7
Don’t make more rules.
